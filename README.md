<h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , Iâ€™m Ana Rita Chambel Pinheiro</h1> 

<p>Slowly but surely consuming the open-source world, one commit at a time. (Baby steps are still steps, right?)</p>

<h2>About me </h2> 
<p>Solutions Engineer by day, open-source enthusiast by night (or whenever I can squeeze in some learning!)</p>

I'm a passionate problem-solver with a knack for building connections (and maybe a slight addiction to a good challenge). 
While I'm brushing off the cobwebs from my college open-source days (hey, everyone needs a refresher!), I'm thrilled to be diving back in.

**Currently:**

* Having a blast as a Virtual Solutions Engineer at Cloudflare (who doesn't love a good internet challenge?)
* Embarking on a (slightly belated) open-source journey â€“ one commit at a time! ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ (Yes, I'm Portuguese â€“ but multilingual aspirations are in the works! Swedish, anyone?)
* When I'm not wrangling code, you can find me:
    * Molding masterpieces (clay, not code, in this case â€“ it's called ceramics!)
    * Devouring a good book (always open to recommendations!)
    * Spinning a yarn (storyteller in training, watch out world!)
    * Showering my pets with love (because who doesn't need furry friends?)
    * Savoring delicious food (life's too short for bad eats!)
